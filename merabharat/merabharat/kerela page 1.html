             <h2>About</h2>
             <p>Kerala, southwestern coastal state of India. It is a small state, constituting only about 1 percent of the total area of the country.Kerala has been exposed to many foreign influences via its long coastline.The state has developed a unique culture within the subcontinent, not only with a diverse religious tradition but also with its own language, Malayalam.Kerala is a region of great natural beauty.
             Flanked by the Arabian Sea in the West, the towering Western Ghats in the East and networked by 44 interconnected rivers, Kerala is blessed with a unique set of geographical features that have made it one of the most sought after tourist destinations in Asia.
             A long shoreline with serene beaches, tranquil stretches of emerald backwaters, lush hill stations and exotic wildlife, are just a few of the wonders that await you once you crossover to the other side. And what's more, each of these charming destinations is only a two hour drive from the other - a singular advantage no other place on the planet can offer. 
             Bestowed with a pleasant and equable climate throughout the year, Kerala is a tropical land where one can relax and be at ease. The Monsoons (June-September and October-November) and summer (February-May) are the seasons markedly experienced here, while Winter is only a slight drop in temperature from the normal range of 28-32Â°C. The generally pleasant climate prevalent here is  what our guests end up loving.
             kerala prides itself for being the flag bearer for not just how a culture can respect its past but also march forward with growth & progress as well. Hundred percent literacy, world-class health care systems, India's lowest infant mortality and highest life expectancy rates are among a few of the milestones that the people of the state are extremely proud of.
